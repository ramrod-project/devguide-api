You'll also want to save frequently, with FILE-- >SAVE AS CHECKPOINT, as well as using the DOWNLOAD AS .pynb, which will allow you to archive your plugin development progress in the event your system is restarted. While it is also possible to map your host machine folder to the container folder, allowing access to your Plugin notebook file, it is preferable to deliberately save and track the progress of your work using features within this Jupyter notebook application. **\n",

As a result, if additional language support is required (KERNEL showing on the right top corner of this notebook), the running container must have access to internet-accessible repositories, or we would rebuild this custom image after loading the desired Kernel.
